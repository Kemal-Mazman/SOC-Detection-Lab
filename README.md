# 🧪 Cybersecurity Home Lab – PC1 Phase

Welcome to my cybersecurity home lab documentation!

This repo tracks my progress as I build a hands-on lab environment to explore both blue team (defensive) and red team (offensive) skills — starting with PC1 (Ubuntu-based analyst/attacker system).

---

## 🖥️ Current Setup: PC1 (Ubuntu Linux)

PC1 is my main system for analysis, simulation, and offensive testing.

### Tools Installed on Host (Ubuntu):
- **ClamAV** – antivirus scanning
- **chkrootkit** – rootkit detection
- **Lynis** – system auditing & hardening reports
- **Wireshark** – packet capture & network analysis

### 🧪 Offensive Environment (Kali Linux VM):
- Running in **VirtualBox**
- Preloaded with key red team tools
  -  **Metasploit Framework 2**
  -  **nmap**, **hydra**, and other standard tools

---

## 🔧 Use Cases So Far:
- Capturing and analyzing network traffic with Wireshark
- Scanning with Kali Linux (e.g., nmap, metasploit basics)
- Simulated attacks from Kali → Host for analysis
- Documenting and reflecting on each tool used

---

## 🌱 Lab Goals (Current Phase)
- Practice both defensive and offensive tool usage
- Learn how to detect attacks from Kali using logs or network captures
- Build documentation I can share and reflect on
- Prepare for full blue team lab with Proxmox and switches (coming soon)

## 🔄 Update Schedule
I’ll be updating this lab **monthly** with new configurations, experiments, lessons learned, and possibly even diagrams.
